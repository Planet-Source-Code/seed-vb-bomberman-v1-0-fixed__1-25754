Thank you for downloading VB Bomberman!

	This project just started small.  I originally wanted to just make the engine and share it with PSC but when I realized that it had potential, I began to develop it.  Even though I totally suck at graphics, all of them are done by me (except the ones on the title screen, which I got from some website.)  I managed to make all those decent looking graphics in Paint, believe it or not.  

	I saw another version of Bomberman on PSC, but I was very disappointed -- not in the graphics and gameplay (which were exceptionally done - in DX8) but in the authors lack of real game.  It had no powerups and iffy collision detection.  It was hardly even a finished game.  The author said it wasn't complete, but why did he/she stop?  It was good except that.  Anyway, my game is a full version w/ sounds, levels, powerups, and more.  Unfortunatley, my wimpy graphics and the unrealistic movement are the only real letdowns.  But for a VB game i still think mine is OK.

	Anyways, I think the engine runs smoothly without a bug (but I'm sure some will pop up for some people, it never fails!)  If you like the game then please vote!  Voting and feedback help us grow, hehe.  And don't say you don't like it for no reason.  

	By the way, I'm looking to make a new game.  I don't want to make an adventure game, but I would maybe do an RPG?  Well, if you have any ideas, mail me:
